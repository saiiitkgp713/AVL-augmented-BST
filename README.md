# AVL-augmented-BST
AVL augmentation for Binary Search Tree.

Python Implementation for AVL Tree.

The Conventional BST faces a problem of skweing. Sometimes most of the values in the datastructure are present either to the right of the root or to the left. In these situations the time complexity of operations like insertion, deletion etc., may spike and become linear O(n) rather than O(logn).

This is called an Unbalanced Tree. To modify this, AVL agumentation is done to the original Algorithm. This augmentation of algorithm ensures that the tree is balanced making the time complexity O(logn). That's Why AVL Tree is also called self Balancing Tree.
